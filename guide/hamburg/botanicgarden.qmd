The Botanic Garden in Hamburg Klein Flottbek is a very nice place to visit during summer. 

## Where?

Just get off the S1 at the "Klein Flottbek" stop and you are right in front of it :)

## What to do?

Whether it is walking through a bamboo forest, sitting underneath big mammut trees or watching turtles sunbathe on hot stones in the water - big recommendation!
