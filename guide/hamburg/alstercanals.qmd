## What?

Hamburg's canals are among the most beautiful features of the city. Especially the Alster canals in Eppendorf and Winterhude offer beautiful views of impressive houses and scenic gardens. Among many options to cruise along the Alster canals, stand-up paddling is a fun way to explore alone or with friends.

Due to its popularity, there are many SUP rentals in Hamburg. Just check out where you would like to start your tour and you'll surely find a rental nearby!
