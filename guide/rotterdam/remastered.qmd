## What is Remastered?

> "Experience what you have never experienced before. The old Dutch Masters reimagined by the new Dutch Masters. The very best Dutch digital artists have created a new world. A world where you go on parade with the unearthly creatures of Jeroen Bosch, get immersed in the colourful scenes of Van Gogh and dance on the beat of Mondrianâ€™s 'Victory Boogie Woogie'.
This unique 60-minute experience also includes walking through a waterfall, making your own UFO fly on a gigantic LED Screen, interacting with schools of fish and sailing through the clouds."
