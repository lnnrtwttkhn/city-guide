## Overview

Rotterdam is a pretty international city, featuring restaurants originating from all over the world. Below are some Asian restaurants that are quite popular among the Asians in the city. 

  - Seoul Sista
    Seoul Sista is an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ. Our Korean colleague said it's 'authentic enough'
    
  - Soju Bar
    Also a Korean restaurant but this time for fried chicken. It is said that their Bibimbap is great as well. Very popular
    
  - Le Souq
    Nice and authentic Lebanese restaurant that all my colleagues love :) They offer various sorts of appetizers/starters that you could explore all different flavors.
