There are a couple of nice Italian restaurants that could be added to the city guide for Rotterdam:

- Old Scuola: available in two locations (Centre, West), you can find great pizza here and a nice selection of appetizers.

- Panzer√≤: very close to the Marktal, here you can find traditional panzerotti from Puglia (South Italy) which are very good small fried pizzas filled with delicious ingredients!
